# Battleship Bingo - Project Summary & Implementation Guide

---

## 📦 Deliverables Overview

This document summarizes all the work completed for the Battleship Bingo event system.

### ✅ Completed Features

#### 1. **Extensive Bingo Task Library** (`public/data/bingo-tiles.json`)
- **180+ unique, repeatable OSRS tasks** across all categories:
  - PvM (Boss kills, Slayer, Wilderness)
  - Skills (XP gains, resource gathering)
  - Raids (CoX, ToB, ToA)
  - Minigames (Pest Control, Wintertodt, LMS, etc.)
  - Clue Scrolls (all tiers)
  - Collection tasks (rare items)
  - Achievement Diaries
  - Quests
  
- All tasks are **repeatable** and suitable for competitive events
- Tasks range from easy (100 points) to extreme difficulty (400 points)
- Each task includes an OSRS Wiki icon reference

#### 2. **Abstract Game Mechanic Buffs/Debuffs** (`public/data/buffs-debuffs.json`)
- **30 Buffs** - Game-mechanic advantages:
  - Point multipliers (2x, 3x points)
  - Tactical advantages (reveal enemy ships, bomb shields)
  - Strategic buffs (chain reactions, team rallies)
  - Time manipulation (quick complete, progress accelerator)
  - Special abilities (wild card, critical strike, resurrection)
  
- **30 Debuffs** - Game-mechanic challenges:
  - Point penalties (half points, zero points, delayed rewards)
  - Time restrictions (time locks, time bombs)
  - Visibility issues (reveal your ships, priority target)
  - Team hindrances (solo missions, team locks)
  - Tactical disadvantages (spread damage, sabotage)

- All effects are **abstract** (no direct gameplay modifiers)
- Effects trigger based on game events (tile completion, bombing)
- Durations range from instant to permanent
-Effects are clearly game-mechanical, not gameplay-affecting

#### 3. **Vertical Global Navigation** (Shadcn Sidebar)
- **Left sidebar navigation** replacing top navbar
- Collapsible sidebar (icon-only mode)

- User info in sidebar footer:
  - Discord avatar
  - Discord tag
  - Member code
  
- Smooth transitions and hover states
- Mobile responsive

#### 4. **Enhanced Admin Board Builder**
- **Dual-sidebar layout:**
  - Left: Navigation between "Board Editor" and "Buffs & Debuffs Manager"
  - Right: Available tiles list with drag-and-drop
  
- **Board Editor Features:**

  - Dropdown selection for each tile
  - Detailed descriptions with durations

#### 5. **Comprehensive Database Schema** (`docs/DATABASE_SCHEMA.md`)

## 💡 Creative Ideas for Future Updates

### 1. Tile Marketplace
- Teams can trade tiles mid-event
- Bid system with points
- Adds economic strategy layer

### 2. Dynamic Events

- Random events (e.g., "Supply drop" adds bonus tiles)
- Boss invasions (NPC bombs random tiles)

### 3. Spectator Mode
- Public view of event board (ships hidden)
- Live commentary system
- Twitch integration for watch parties

### 4. Player Specializations
- Players choose roles (Bomber, Defender, Rusher, etc.)
- Role-specific bonuses
- Team composition strategy

### 5. Seasonal Progression
- Player levels across events
- Unlock cosmetic rewards
- Prestige system
- Hall of Fame

### 6. Cross-Clan Tournaments
- Bracket-style elimination
- Best of 3 matches
- Grand finals with massive prize pool

# Battleship Bingo - Complete Game Rules & Guide
## The Ultimate OSRS Team Competition

---

## üéØ Game Overview

**Battleship Bingo** is a hybrid strategy game that combines the tactical ship placement of Battleship with the competitive task completion of Bingo, set in the world of Old School RuneScape.

Two teams compete on a shared grid where they secretly place ships (groups of tiles), complete OSRS tasks to claim tiles, and strategically bomb enemy positions to sink their ships and disrupt their progress.

**Win Conditions:**
1. Sink all enemy ships **OR**
2. Complete a predetermined number of tiles (e.g., full row, column, or point threshold) **OR**
3. Have the highest score when time expires

---

## üìã Pre-Game Setup

### 1. Event Creation (Admin)
- Admin creates a Battleship Bingo event via the Admin Panel
- Sets board dimensions (default: 30 columns √ó 15 rows = 450 tiles)
- Assigns tasks from the master tile list to each coordinate
- Optionally assigns buffs/debuffs to specific tiles
- Configures game rules (points, time limits, ship counts, etc.)
- Sets event start and end times

### 2. Team Formation
- Event organizer divides players into **2 teams**
- Each team gets:
  - Team name and color
  - Team captain (optional, for coordination)
  - Private team communication channel (Discord)
  - Equal number of ships to place

### 3. Ship Placement Phase
**Duration:** 24-48 hours before event start

**Rules:**
- Each team places **5 ships** of varying sizes on the board
- Ship sizes: 1x **Patrol Boat** (3 tiles), 2x **Submarines** (4 tiles), 1x **Destroyer** (5 tiles), 1x **Carrier** (6 tiles)
- Ships can be placed horizontally or vertically (NOT diagonally)
- Ships cannot overlap
- Ships cannot be placed on adjacent tiles (must have 1-tile gap)
- Ship locations are **hidden** from the enemy team
- Once placed, ships cannot be moved

**Strategic Considerations:**
- Place ships on high-value tiles (double/triple points)
- Protect ships with buff tiles (e.g., "Steal Protection", "Ship Armor")
- Consider task difficulty - easier tasks = faster completion
- Spread ships to minimize area-of-effect bomb damage

### Phase 2: Mid-Game - Strategic Warfare

## üé≤ Core Mechanics

### Tile Claims
1. Any team member can **claim** an unclaimed tile
2. Claimed tiles are **locked** to that team (unless stolen via special buff)
3. Only the claiming team's members can work on that tile
4. Tiles can be in multiple states:
   - **Unclaimed:** Available to either team
   - **Claimed:** Reserved by a team, task not started
   - **In Progress:** Player(s) actively working on task
   - **Pending Review:** Proof submitted, awaiting admin verification
   - **Completed:** Verified and points awarded
   - **Bombed:** Hit by enemy bomb (see effects below)

### Task Completion
1. Player works on OSRS task (e.g., "Kill Zulrah 25 times")
2. Player tracks progress and submits updates
3. Upon completion, player uploads **proof** (screenshot/video)
4. Admin or automated system **verifies** proof
5. Points awarded to team
6. Tile marked as completed

**Proof Requirements:**
- Screenshot must show:
  - Task completion (e.g., Collection Log, Chat Log, WiseOldMan stats)
  - In-game name visible
  - Timestamp (in-game clock or system clock)
- Video for high-value tiles (at admin's discretion)
- Proof must be achievable within event time frame (no pre-event progress)

### Bombing System
**Daily Bomb Allocation:**
- Each team receives **10 bombs per day** (configurable)
- Bombs reset at midnight UTC
- Unused bombs do not carry over

**Bomb Mechanics:**
1. Team selects a coordinate to bomb (e.g., "L7")
2. System checks if that tile contains an enemy ship
3. **Results:**
   - **MISS:** Tile has no enemy ship
   - **HIT:** Tile contains enemy ship segment (ship takes damage)
   - **SUNK:** Final segment of ship destroyed (ship eliminated)
   - **BLOCKED:** Buff protected the tile

**Bombing Effects:**
- **On Hit:** 
  - Ship segment marked as destroyed
  - Enemy team notified of hit (but not exact coordinate)
  - Bombing team earns 50 points
  - If tile was completed by enemy, their points are nullified

- **On Sunk:**
  - Entire ship revealed to bombing team
  - Bombing team earns 500 bonus points
  - Enemy team loses all points from that ship's tiles
  - Enemy's remaining ships count decreases

- **On Miss:**
  - No effect
  - Information revealed: "No ship at this location"

**Strategic Bombing:**
- Use completed enemy tiles as clues (they often protect ships)
- Target high-value areas (center, corners)
- Coordinate with teammates to map enemy ships
- Save bombs for end-game if winning on points

### Buffs & Debuffs
**Trigger:** Completing a tile with an assigned buff/debuff

**Buff Examples:**
- **Double Points:** This tile awards 2x points (immediate)
- **Chain Reaction:** Unlocks all adjacent tiles for your team (immediate)
- **Reveal Enemy:** Shows 3 random enemy ship locations (immediate)
- **Bomb Shield:** Next 2 enemy bombs miss your ships (ongoing, charges)
- **Team Rally:** Next 3 tiles by any teammate give +50% points (ongoing, 6 hours)

**Debuff Examples:**
- **Time Lock:** Must wait 48 hours after claiming before completion counts (tile-specific)
- **Point Penalty:** This tile only awards 50% points (immediate)
- **Reveal Ships:** Completing this shows 2 of YOUR ship locations to enemy (immediate)
- **Time Bomb:** Must complete within 24 hours or lose 200 points (ongoing)
- **Cursed Tile:** Completing this gives enemy team +100 points (immediate)

**Buff/Debuff Strategy:**
- Buffs are often on difficult or time-consuming tiles
- Debuffs may be on easy tiles (trade-off)
- Some buffs/debuffs are hidden until tile is claimed
- Teams can see buff/debuff icons on tiles before claiming

### Point System
**Base Points per Tile:** 100 points (configurable by admin)

**Point Modifiers:**
- Tile difficulty:
  - Easy: 100 points
  - Medium: 150 points
  - Hard: 250 points
  - Extreme: 400 points
- Buff multipliers (e.g., Double Points = 2x)
- Combo bonuses (complete 3 tiles in a row within 1 hour = +25% each)
- Speed bonuses (complete tile within first 10% of event time = +50 points)

**Bonus Points:**
- Hit enemy ship segment: **+50**
- Sink enemy ship: **+500**
- Complete full row: **+1,000**
- Complete full column: **+1,000**

## üé™ Advanced Strategies

- Risk: Higher chance of discovery
- Reward: Massive point lead if protected

**Defensive Placement:**
- Place ships on easy, fast-completion tiles
- Risk: Lower point potential
- Reward: Quick completion, ships protected early

**Hybrid Placement:**
- Mix of difficult and easy tiles
- Spread across board
- Balanced risk/reward

### Tile Priority Matrix
**High Priority:**

**Denial Bombing:**

- All-in on remaining ship locations
- High-risk, high-reward

### Team Coordination
